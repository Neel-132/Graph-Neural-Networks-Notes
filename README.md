### Graph Neural Network notes
This repository contains handwritten notes about Graph Neural Networks. GNNs have achieved state of the art results in several tasks which make them a well explored area of deep learning. Anyone who want to start reading about GNNs can make use of these notes.
These notes are inspired by Jure Leskovec's [ML with Graphs playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn&ab_channel=StanfordOnline) and is divided into three parts:
  1. Part 1 - GNN Introduction and famous architectures (GCN, Graph SAGE, GAT)
  2. Part 2 - Graph Augmentation techniques and designing the GNN training pipeline
  3. Part 3 - Setting up GNN tasks and analyzing the capablities of a Graph Neural Network.
